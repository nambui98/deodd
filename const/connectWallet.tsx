        DO I HAVE A FLIPPING PROBLEM?
        Flipping problem includes all behavior patterns that compromise, disrupt, or damage any personal, family, or vocational pursuits. Symptoms include increasing preoccupation with flipping, a need to flip more and more frequently, restlessness or irritability when attempting to stop, “chasing” losses, and loss of control manifested by continuation of the flipping behavior in spite of mounting, serious, and/or negative consequence.
