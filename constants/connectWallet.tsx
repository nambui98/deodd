      <h5>Do I have a flipping problem?</h5>
      <p>
        If you feel you are having trouble with your gambling, ask yourself the following questions:<br />
        Have other people ever criticized your flipping?<br />
        Do you ever lie to cover up the money or time spent on your flipping?<br />
        Do arguments, boredom, or frustration make you want to flip?<br />
        Have you lost interest in family, friends, or entertainment due to flipping?<br />
        When flipping and you run out of money, do you feel frustrated and hopeless and need to take it back ASAP?<br />
        Have you lied, stolen, or borrowed to get money to flipping or to repay the flipping debt?<br />
        The more you answer &quot;yes&quot; to these questions, the more likely you have serious gambling problems. Consider pausing your action of playing if you have the above signs.
